Techniques for assessing your current work-life balance include:

### Time-Tracking

Time-tracking involves keeping a record of how time is being spent throughout the day or week. This can involve using an app or software to track time spent on specific tasks or activities. This allows individuals to identify areas of overcommitment or time-wasting, and adjust their schedules and priorities accordingly.

### Evaluation of Activities

Evaluating activities involves reflecting on which activities bring the most joy and fulfillment, and which tasks or responsibilities are causing the most stress or dissatisfaction. This can involve making a list of all work-related and personal activities, and rating them based on how much enjoyment or stress they provide.

### Taking Inventory of Personal Values and Priorities

Taking inventory of personal values and priorities involves identifying what matters most outside of work, such as family, hobbies, or personal growth. This helps individuals prioritize non-work related activities and ensure that they align with personal values and goals.

### Seeking Feedback

Seeking feedback from trusted colleagues, mentors, or loved ones can provide valuable insight into how time and energy are being allocated between work and personal life. This allows individuals to identify potential blind spots or areas of improvement.

### Regular Reflection

Regular reflection involves taking dedicated time to reflect on how current work-life balance aligns with short-term and long-term goals. This can involve journaling, meditation, or other self-reflection techniques.
